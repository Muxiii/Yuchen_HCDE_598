#   CREATION DATE: March, 2024
#   AUTHOR: David W. McDonald
#
#   Prototype: 1
#   Version: 1
#
#   This is the code for a very simple chat prototype of a movie recommender. The main
#   enhancement for this version is the creation of a MOVIE_RECOMMENDER_PERSONA_PROMPT 
#   to try and make the LLM respond consistently with movie recommendations.

#   This example will use an OpenAI service

#   One should never put their key right in the code like this
#   A later prototype will show an alternative that solves this problem
API_KEY = "Your_API_Key"
#
#   Depending on what model and what service you are using, the prior 
#   version (p.v:1.0) might not make any movie recommendation. One way to 
#   fix that is with the use of a 'system' message. A 'system' turn is one 
#   way to create a persona for the assistant that responds to the user.
#   Here we will set up a very simple movie recommender persona and try to
#   get the assistant to always respond with a movie.

Make sure that the movie you recommend satisfies the user across many movie attributes including genre, actors, visuals, music, plot line, character development, dialog, mood, and many other movie attributes. Your responses should always focus on making movie recommendations.'''
